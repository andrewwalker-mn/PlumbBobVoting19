# PlumbBobVoting19
Contains a random key generator and a vote counter that tallies responses, excluding those with invalid or duplicate keys. Also includes a ticketchopper, which takes the list of keys generated by the randomnumgenerator and formats them into rows of 20.

1. First run Randomnumgenerator.py to generate a csv "ticketnumbers.csv" of voting keys. Edit to change parameters for largest and smallest possible keys and number of keys to generate. 
2. Run ticketchopper.py which reformats "ticketnumbers.csv" into rows of 20 and saves it as "choppedtix.csv". 
3. You need to format choppedtix.csv in excel and save it as an excel file to print and slice in a paper cutter.
4. Make a royalty voting google form that requires email login to umn with two responses, the first for the key, and the second for the candidate. 
5. Hand out the slips to eventgoers and encourage them to vote for candidates with the google form.
6. At any point during the week, you can download the form results as a .csv file and run Counter.py to output a new "cleanresults.csv" file. The numbers next to the names of candidates are the number of valid nonduplicate votes.
You can redownload the form results at any point during the week and repeat step 6 to get updated results.
